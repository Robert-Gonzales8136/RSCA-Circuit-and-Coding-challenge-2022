# RSCA-Circuit-and-Coding-challenge-2022
My submission for CSULB's week of RSCA circuit and coding challenge in 2022. I won second place. My submission was missing some features when I submitted because I ran out of time. This version has all the challenges and bonus points except for the LCD display. Circuit explanation in the readme file.
